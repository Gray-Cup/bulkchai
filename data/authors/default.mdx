Arjun Aditya is a builder and founder with experience across developer tooling, infrastructure, and consumer brands. He has worked on early-stage products at Zerops and later founded Coldran, where he focused on building scalable systems and practical engineering solutions.

Over time, his interests expanded beyond software into consumer goods and supply chains, which led to the creation of GrayCup — a company focused on tea, coffee, and sourcing quality products with consistency and clarity. His work today sits at the intersection of technology, operations, and everyday products people actually use.

Arjun believes that good businesses are built quietly: by understanding fundamentals, removing unnecessary complexity, and respecting the end user. This philosophy influences how GrayCup approaches sourcing, quality control, and transparency across its platforms.

When not working, he spends time exploring systems design, reading about economics and markets, and experimenting with product ideas that connect physical goods with modern infrastructure. He prefers building things that compound slowly rather than chasing short-term trends.
