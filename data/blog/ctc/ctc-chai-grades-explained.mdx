# Why Understanding CTC Chai Matters More Than Just the Price

If you are buying chai in bulk — whether for a café, office supply, retail counter,
or resale — one thing becomes clear very quickly: not all chai is the same.

Most buyers start with a simple question: _“What is the price per kilo?”_  
Price matters, of course. But anyone who has worked with chai for some time knows
that price alone does not decide whether a tea will actually work for a business.

## What Exactly Is CTC Chai?

CTC stands for **Crush, Tear, Curl**. In this process, tea leaves are crushed and
rolled into small, uniform particles. This is why CTC chai brews quickly, gives
strong colour, and works especially well for milk-based Indian chai.

However, even within CTC tea, there are many variations. Two teas can both be
called “CTC chai” and still behave very differently in the cup.

## Why Some Chai Is Darker Than Others

Many people assume darker chai always means stronger or better chai. In reality,
colour depends on several factors:

- Particle size
- Oxidation during processing
- Seasonal variation
- The tea garden and origin

Very fine particles release colour quickly, but that does not always guarantee a
clean or balanced taste. Sometimes a slightly lighter-looking chai performs better
across multiple brews.

## Common CTC Chai Grades Explained

| Grade                     | Particle Size | Liquor Colour       | Typical Use                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| BP (Broken Pekoe)         | Medium        | Bright & clean      | Balanced chai for cafés and retail |
| BOP (Broken Orange Pekoe) | Medium–small  | Strong & brisk      | Offices and daily consumption      |
| PF (Pekoe Fannings)       | Small         | Dark & fast brewing | High-volume chai preparation       |
| PD (Pekoe Dust)           | Very small    | Very dark           | Roadside stalls and strong blends  |
| Dust                      | Finest        | Extremely dark      | Cost-focused bulk blending         |

## A Simple Rule for Bulk Chai Buyers

When buying chai in bulk, do not look at price alone. Ask about the grade, particle
size, colour, and consistency. These details decide whether the chai performs
reliably or creates problems later.

Good bulk chai is not about chasing the lowest rate — it is about choosing tea
that delivers the same result, cup after cup.
